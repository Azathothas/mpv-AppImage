# mpv AppImage

Unofficial AppImage of mpv: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------

There is also a experimental WIP `anylinux` AppImage in the releases, that AppImage bundles everything using the deploy everything mode of [go-appimage](https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage) which makes it able to work on any linux distrution, be it distributions older than the current debian stable or even **musl distributions**

However I can't get it to play youtube videos, that is why it is labeled as WIP.
